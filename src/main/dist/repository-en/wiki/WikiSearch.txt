= Simple Search

The wiki search allows you to quickly find wiki pages. The following examples show how to use it.

Find pages by a simple word:
@@
word
@@

Find pages by several words, all of them have to occur in a wiki page:
@@
two words
@@

To search for a phrase with spaces, surround it by double quotes:
@@
"search phrase with space"
@@

Certainly, you can combine all of them:
@@
"search phrase with space" word "another search phrase"
@@

The wiki search is case insensitive and ignores accents (diacritics). "ß" and "ss" are treated as equal. E.g. the search for "resume" will also match the word "Résumé".

= Excluding text

To exclude wiki pages that contain specific words or phrases, add them with a leading minus:
@@
word -dontfind -"text phrase to exclude"
@@

= Extended Search with Regular Expressions

Complex search queries can be described by regular expressions. They have to start with "regex:".

Find wiki pages with a word that contains at least two "f" characters:
@@
regex:f\S*f
@@

If the regular expression contains a space, the whole part has to be surrounded by double quotes.
Certainly you can combine regular expressions and phrases:
@@
"regex:r a" other words
@@

For a detailed syntax description of regular expressions see [[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html]].
